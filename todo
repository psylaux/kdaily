- create the code to insert my user into the database
    - when i run /hanaday, check if my userid exists in the users table,
        - if not, add my user
        - if it does, check if it is already in an active set
            - if active set is true
                - you already have an active set. 
                - do you want to stop it?
        - else continue to creating set
    - when set is created, parse it and add it to the activeSet table
        - be sure to also set users table active set to true
    - every day at 2:30pm send one item to my dms
        - increment activeDayNumber and use that number to get the correct word to send
        - when activeDayNumber = totalDayNumber, this is the last day.
            - create a function: setCompleted
                - delete set from activesets after sending
                - set active in users table to false
                - reset data to 0

- you may need to create a separate worker file that watches just the userid, username


- complete hanaday set up
    - allow up to 2 set regenerations
        - pull out the generation code into a function
- make it usable on new servers

- watch a few videos on spaced repetition
